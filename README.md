# Image-Compression-using-K-means

This repository features a Jupyter Notebook implementation of K-Means image compression, where the K-Means clustering algorithm is utilized to significantly reduce the number of colors in an image while preserving its overall visual quality. By grouping similar colors into clusters and replacing them with their centroids, the image's color palette is effectively reduced, resulting in a more compact representation of the original image. The interactive visualizations allow users to experiment with varying the number of clusters, observing the impact on image quality. This educational resource offers a hands-on experience in image processing, data compression, and machine learning techniques using Python and popular data science libraries, welcoming contributions from developers to enhance and optimize the code further.
